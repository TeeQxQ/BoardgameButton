# BoardgameButton
Button for various board game purposes to indicate player actions

## Improvement ideas:
* Wifi network reconnection, try also optional networks if connection is lost
* Don't require Drive connection, cache changes while waiting connection
* Store changes to SD card, flush when connection re-established
* Replace master button with box
* Add effects (more than blinking)
* Add general implementation for effects
* Add led indicators for different phases
