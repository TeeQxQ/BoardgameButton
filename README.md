# BoardgameButton
Button for various board game purposes to indicate player actions and to log interesting data

## Features

## Improvement ideas:
* ~~Wifi network reconnection, try also optional networks if connection is lost~~
* ~~Don't require Drive connection, cache changes while waiting connection~~
* Add id to turn entries, log may be succesfull even though receiving the answer failed
* Store changes to SD card, flush when connection re-established
* ~~Replace master button with box~~
* ~~Add effects (more than blinking)~~
* Add general implementation for effects
* ~~Add led indicators for different phases~~
* ~~Record time between turns~~
* General game settings implementation
* ~~Read game settings (e.g. game logic, turn length indicator...) via Google Drive~~
* ~~Add super long button press + effect~~
* ~~Sometimes long button press occurs (timers haven't been reseted?)~~

## V2 improvement ideas:

* Lighter battery
* Brighter bulb
* Color changing bulb
* Sound indicator
* OTA updates
* Unlimited number of players
