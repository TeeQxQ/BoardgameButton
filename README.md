# BoardgameButton
Button for various board game purposes to indicate player actions

## Features

## Improvement ideas:
* ~~Wifi network reconnection~~, try also optional networks if connection is lost
* Don't require Drive connection, cache changes while waiting connection
* Store changes to SD card, flush when connection re-established
* ~~Replace master button with box
* ~~Add effects (more than blinking)
* Add general implementation for effects
* ~~Add led indicators for different phases
* Record time between turns
* General game settings implementation
* Read game settings (e.g. game logic, turn length indicator...) via Google Drive
* Add super long button press + effect
